The CO2 and water vapor exchange between leaf and atmosphere are relevant for plant physiology. This process is 
done through the stomata. These structures are fundamental in the study of plants since their properties are 
linked to the evolutionary process of the plant, its environmental and phytohormonal conditions. Stomatal 
detection is a complex task due to the noise and morphology of the microscopic images. Although in recent years 
segmentation algorithms have been developed that automate this process, they all use techniques that explore
chromatic characteristics. This research explores a unique feature in plants, which corresponds to the stomatal 
spatial distribution within the leaf structure. Unlike segmentation techniques based on deep learning tools,
we emphasize the search for an optimal threshold level, so that a high percentage of stomata can be detected, 
independent of the size and shape of the stomata. This last feature has not been reported in the literature,
except for those results of geometric structure formation in the salt formation and other biological formations.
